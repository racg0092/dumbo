## CORE
  - [ ] Start clean up routines for expired session


## API 
- [ ] Add a set value that only adds the value to the in memory but it does not save for use when multiple values must be set


## Issues
- [ ] There are fundamental issues into how the API and internal logic works that does not allow for flexibility with sessions
  - [ ] Review internal logic
  - [ ] Find points of possible improvement
  - [ ] Goals are to have multiple sessions for single user for diffrent purposes
